# viper_simplecov

Viper package for simplecov Ruby support.
## Version 0.1.0

## Abstract

Adds support for the SimpleCov Ruby gem to the Viper Programmer's Editor. [Viper GitHub page](https://github.com/edhowland/viper)

This package only adds commands and parsing for simplecov-json files. It does not actually run the simplecov program on
your source files. You must do that separately. Once you generate a coverage report in JSON format, you can
load it into the Viper editor and browse the report.
